# lab-assignment-1
Base project for lab assignment 1
1.- Elements tab. The document starts with the <html> tag to give a start for the document, after this, comes the <head> tab, where we find somo meta data for general settings of the html document,
    then some links marked under the href="" finally the <title> Hacker News </head> (marked in orange and to the right of the title are all the links) after the header comes the <body> where the pages info is stored.
	We can see a <center> tab where a <table> is placed, this is the table in light grey color we see in the page (inside the table tag, are the settings for the table itself) the table is organized by <tbody> or table body,
	followed by <tr> tags for table rows inside some rows we find <td> tags for table align by default, sometimes one can also see the <span> tag for making diferent sections, or separating elements from eachother.
	At the end we find a <script> calls a javascript file, for animations or passing ajax requests (GET, POST).
	
2.- Sources tab. Inside the top folder at the news.ycombinator.com folder, are 6 files. The index (in grey), that rederects you to the ycombinator.com page and has the code of the html file, the second file 
	hn.js... (in yellow) is where the functions that the webpage uses are for example where the ajax request pases GET requests. The third file (in purple) is the CSS style for the web page, it houses things such as pictures
	or the font definitions. The last three files .gif (in green) are icons used in the page for example the Y icon on the top left, next to the header title.
	
3.- Network tab. XHR, is short for XMLHttpRequest, produced by microsoft this is a javascript object, that allows an easy way to get an URLÂ´s information without having to reload the page. This way a web page can reload a section 
	of itself usign AJAX, as well as sending and receiving data from a server. In the network tab we see a bar graph, that shows how much time it took for all the elements in the page to be loaded and displayed. On my page it took
	706ms to load the hole page.
